# SpaceTradersClient
A client for the spacetraders.io v2 API

To begin working with this, you need to create a file in the root called `appconfig.local.json` with this content:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "apiKey": "THIS IS THE JWT FROM SPACE TRADERS AVAILABLE AT https://docs.spacetraders.io/quickstart/new-game"
  }
}
```
